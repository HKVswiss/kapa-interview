Problems:
    1. scanned doccument is not read in the current setup
    1. No Image is completely processsed




Thouht process:
    1. This is not such a realtime application, if there are multiple pdf readers one for text other tables, images, i could ensemble them at page level to make a clean consolidated mardown
    2. I could use LLM to consolidate in an iterative loop
    3. its mentioned that gpt4.1 is used does this have multi model capabilities so some question related to image can be ansered
     
1. After fixing the pdf reader all the paragraphs of text was corrected. 
All the question have been answered but page numbers are not coming
