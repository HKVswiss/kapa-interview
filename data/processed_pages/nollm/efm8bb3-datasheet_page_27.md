Note:

1. Conversion Time does not include Tracking Time. Total Conversion Time is:

Total Conversion Time = [RPT x (ADTK + NUMBITS + 1) x T(SARCLK)] + (T(ADCCLK) x 4)

where RPT is the number of conversions represented by the ADRPT field and ADCCLK is the clock selected for the ADC.

2. Absolute input pin voltage is limited by the Vio supply.

3. The offset is determined using curve fitting since the specification is measured using linear search where the intercept is always

positive.

4. Production test uses a 2.4 V external reference and external ground.
