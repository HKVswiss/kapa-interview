**Figure 11.3. Package Marking**

The package marking consists of:

 - PPPPPPPP – The part number designation.

 - TTTTTT – A trace or manufacturing code.

 - YY – The last 2 digits of the assembly year.

 - WW – The 2-digit workweek when the device was assembled.

 - # – The device revision (A, B, etc.).
