ESP8266EX has fifive analog pins for power supply, including Pin1, Pin3, Pin4 that are the
power supply for internal PA and LNA; and Pin29, Pin30 for the internal PLL. The operating
voltage for analog power supply pins is 2.5 V ~ 3.6 V.

Note that the power supply channel might be damaged due to the sudden increase of
current when ESP8266EX is transmitting analog signals. Therefore, an additional 10 Î¼F
capacitor with a 0603 or 0805 package is needed to match the 0.1 Î¼F capacitor.

1.4.1.2. Analog Power Supply

ESP8266EX has five analog pins for power supply, including Pin1, Pin3, Pin4 that are the

power supply for internal PA and LNA; and Pin29, Pin3O for the internal PLL. The operating

voltage for analog power supply pins is 2.5 V ~ 3.6 V.

Note that the power supply channel might be damaged due to the sudden increase of

current when ESP8266EX is transmitting analog signals. Therefore, an additional 10 LF

capacitor with a 0603 or 0805 package is needed to match the 0.1 UF capacitor.

.

ESP8266EX's EMC is in conformity with FCC and CE requirements. There is no need to add ferrite

beads in the analog power-supply circuit.

When using a single power supply, the recommended output current is 500 mA.

It is suggested that users add an ESD tube at the power entrance.
