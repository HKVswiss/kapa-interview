## 1.1. Overview


Espressif’s ESP8266EX delivers a highly integrated Wi-Fi SoC solution to meet the
continuous demand for effificient power usage, compact design and reliable performance in
the industry.

With its complete and self-contained Wi-Fi networking capabilities, ESP8266EX can
perform either as a standalone application, or as a slave to a host MCU. When ESP8266EX
hosts an application, it promptly boots up from the external flflash. The integrated highspeed cache optimizes the system's performance and memory.

Also, ESP8266EX can be applied to any micro-controller design as a Wi-Fi adaptor through
SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interfaces.

Besides the Wi-Fi functionalities, ESP8266EX also integrates an enhanced version of
Tensilica’s L106 Diamond series 32-bit processor and on-chip SRAM. It can be interfaced
with external sensors and other devices through the GPIOs, resulting in low development
cost at early stage and minimum footprint. Software Development Kit (SDK) provides
sample codes for various applications.

ESP8266EX integrates antenna switches, RF balun, power amplififier, low-noise receive
amplififier, fifilters and power management modules. The compact design minimizes the PCB
size and the external circuitry.

ESP8266EX enables sophisticated features, such as:

         Fast switching between sleep and wake-up modes for effificient energy use;

         Adaptive radio biasing for low-power operation;

         Advanced signal processing;

         Spur cancellation;

         - Radio co-existence mechanisms for common cellular, Bluetooth, DDR, LVDS, LCD
interference mitigation.

Figure 1-1 shows the functional blocks of ESP8266EX.
