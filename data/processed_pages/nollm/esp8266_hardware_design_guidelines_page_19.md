         - The third layer is the POWER layer where only power lines can be placed. It is
acceptable to place some signal lines under unavoidable circumstances.

         - The forth layer is the BOTTOM layer. Only signal lines can be laid. Placing
components on this layer is not recommended.

Below are the suggestions for a two-layer PCB design.

         The fifirst layer is the TOP layer for signal traces and components.

         - The second layer is the BOTTOM layer, where power traces are routed. Placing any
components on this layer is not recommended. Do not route any power or signal
traces under or around the RF and crystal oscillator, and so that there is a complete
GND plane, which is connected to the Ground Pad at the bottom of the chip.

1.6.2. Positioning a ESP8266EX Module on a Base Board

If users adopt on-board design, they should pay attention to the layout of the module on
the base board. The interference of the base board on the module's antenna performance
should be reduced as much as possible.

It is recommended that the PCB antenna area of the module be placed outside the base
board while the module be put as close as possible to the edge of the base board so that
the feed point of the antenna is closest to the board.
