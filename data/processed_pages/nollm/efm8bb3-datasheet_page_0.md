# **EFM8 Busy Bee Family** **EFM8BB3 Data Sheet**

The EFM8BB3, part of the Busy Bee family of MCUs, is a performance line of 8-bit microcontrollers with a comprehensive analog and digital feature set in small packages.

These devices offer state-of-the-art performance by integrating 12-bit ADC, internal
temperature sensor, and up to four 12-bit DACs into small packages, making them ideal for general purpose applications. With an efficient, pipelined 8051 core with maximum operating frequency at 50 MHz, various communication interfaces, and four channels of configurable logic, the EFM8BB3 family is optimal for many embedded applications.

EFM8BB3 applications include the following:


**KEY FEATURES**

 - Pipelined 8-bit 8051 MCU Core with
50 MHz operating frequency

 - Up to 29 multifunction I/O pins

 - One 12-bit/10-bit ADC

 - Four 12-bit DACs with synchronization
and PWM capabilities

 - Two low-current analog comparators with
built-in reference DACs

 - Internal temperature sensor

 - Internal 49 MHz and 24.5 MHz oscillators

accurate to ±2%

 - Four channels of Configurable Logic

 - 6-channel PWM / PCA

 - Six 16-bit general-purpose timers



- Consumer electronics

- Precision instrumentation

- Power management and control



- Industrial control and automation

- Smart sensors

- Automotive control



























**Lowest power mode with peripheral operational:**

**Normal** **Idle** **Suspend** **Snooze** **Shutdown**
