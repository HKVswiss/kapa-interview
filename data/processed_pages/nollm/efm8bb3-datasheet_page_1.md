With on-chip power-on reset, voltage supply monitor, watchdog timer, and clock oscillator, the EFM8BB3 devices are truly standalone
system-on-a-chip solutions. The flash memory is reprogrammable in-circuit, providing nonvolatile data storage and allowing field upgrades of the firmware. The on-chip debugging interface (C2) allows non-intrusive (uses no on-chip resources), full speed, in-circuit
debugging using the production MCU installed in the final application. This debug logic supports inspection and modification of memory
and registers, setting breakpoints, single stepping, and run and halt commands. All analog and digital peripherals are fully functional
while debugging. Device operation is specified from 2.2 V up to a 3.6 V supply. Devices are AEC-Q100 qualified. Both G-grade and Igrade devices are available in 4x4 mm 32-pin QFN, 3x3 mm 24-pin QFN, 32-pin QFP, or 24-pin QSOP packages. A-grade and additional I-grade devices are available in 5x5 mm 32-pin QFN and 4x4 mm 24-pin QFN packages. All package options are lead-free and
RoHS compliant.
