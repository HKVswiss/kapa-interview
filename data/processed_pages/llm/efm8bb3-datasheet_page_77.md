5. A stainless steel, laser-cut and electro-polished stencil with trapezoidal walls should be used to assure good solder paste release.
6. The stencil thickness should be 0.125 mm (5 mils).
7. The ratio of stencil aperture to land pad size should be 1:1 for all perimeter pads.
8. A 2 x 1 array of 0.7 mm x 1.6 mm openings on a 0.9 mm pitch should be used for the center pad.
