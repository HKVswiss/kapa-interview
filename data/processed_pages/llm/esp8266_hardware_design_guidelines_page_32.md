A test board is embedded in ESP-LAUNCHER, as shown in Figure 2-5. The external size of the test board is 20 mm x 31 mm. A 2-dBi SMA antenna or other testing equipment can be connected to the test board via the SMA antenna connector. The 2.54 mm pin headers make test and development easy and convenient when using a breadboard.
