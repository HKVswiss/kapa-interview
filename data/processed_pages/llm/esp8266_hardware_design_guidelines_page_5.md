# 1. ESP8266EX

## 1.1 Overview

Espressif’s ESP8266EX delivers a highly integrated Wi-Fi SoC solution to meet the continuous demand for efficient power usage, compact design, and reliable performance in the industry.

With its complete and self-contained Wi-Fi networking capabilities, ESP8266EX can perform either as a standalone application or as a slave to a host MCU. When ESP8266EX hosts an application, it promptly boots up from the external flash. The integrated high-speed cache optimizes the system's performance and memory.

ESP8266EX can also be applied to any micro-controller design as a Wi-Fi adaptor through SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interfaces.

Besides the Wi-Fi functionalities, ESP8266EX integrates an enhanced version of Tensilica’s L106 Diamond series 32-bit processor and on-chip SRAM. It can interface with external sensors and other devices through the GPIOs, resulting in low development cost at early stages and a minimum footprint. The Software Development Kit (SDK) provides sample codes for various applications.

ESP8266EX integrates antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power management modules. The compact design minimizes the PCB size and external circuitry.

ESP8266EX enables sophisticated features, such as:

- Fast switching between sleep and wake-up modes for efficient energy use;
- Adaptive radio biasing for low-power operation;
- Advanced signal processing;
- Spur cancellation;
- Radio co-existence mechanisms for common cellular, Bluetooth, DDR, LVDS, LCD interference mitigation.

Figure 1-1 shows the functional blocks of ESP8266EX.
