# EFM8BB3 Data Sheet - QFN32-GI Package Specifications

## Package Notes

1. All dimensions shown are in millimeters (mm) unless otherwise noted.
2. Dimensioning and Tolerancing is per the ANSI Y14.5M-1994 specification.
3. This Land Pattern Design is based on the IPC-7351 guidelines.
4. All dimensions shown are at Maximum Material Condition (MMC). Least Material Condition (LMC) is calculated based on a Fabrication Allowance of 0.05 mm.
5. All metal pads are to be non-solder mask defined (NSMD). Clearance between the solder mask and the metal pad is to be 60 µm minimum, all the way around the pad.
6. A stainless steel, laser-cut and electro-polished stencil with trapezoidal walls should be used to assure good solder paste release.
7. The stencil thickness should be 0.125 mm (5 mils).
8. The ratio of stencil aperture to land pad size should be 1:1 for all perimeter pads.
9. A 2 x 2 array of 1.10 mm square openings on a 1.30 mm pitch should be used for the center pad.
10. A No-Clean, Type-3 solder paste is recommended.
11. The recommended card reflow profile is per the JEDEC/IPC J-STD-020 specification for Small Body Components.
