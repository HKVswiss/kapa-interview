# ESP8266EX Overview

> **Note:** GPIO2, GPIO0, and MTDO are configurable on PCB as the 3-bit strapping register that determines the booting mode and the SDIO timing mode.

## 1.4. Schematic Checklist

The highly-integrated design of ESP8266EX reduces the number of components required. Besides ESP8266EX, less than 10 resistors and capacitors, one crystal oscillator, and one SPI flash are needed to make a complete module with wireless communication capability.

The following is a detailed description of ESP8266EX schematics and the layout design which ensures optimum functionality.

The complete circuit diagram of ESP8266EX is illustrated in Figure 1-3.
