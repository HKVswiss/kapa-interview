# ESP8266EX Overview

> **Note:** GPIO2, GPIO0, and MTDO are configurable on the PCB as the 3-bit strapping register that determines the booting mode and the SDIO timing mode.

## 1.4. Schematic Checklist

The highly-integrated design of the ESP8266EX reduces the number of components required. Besides the ESP8266EX chip itself, less than 10 resistors and capacitors, one crystal oscillator, and one SPI flash are needed to make a complete module with wireless communication capability.

The following is a detailed description of the ESP8266EX schematics and the layout design which ensures optimum functionality.

The complete circuit diagram of ESP8266EX is illustrated in Figure 1-3.
