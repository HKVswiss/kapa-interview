# EFM8 Busy Bee Family - EFM8BB3 Data Sheet

The EFM8BB3, part of the Busy Bee family of MCUs, is a performance line of 8-bit microcontrollers with a comprehensive analog and digital feature set in small packages.

These devices offer state-of-the-art performance by integrating a 12-bit ADC, internal temperature sensor, and up to four 12-bit DACs into small packages, making them ideal for general purpose applications. With an efficient, pipelined 8051 core with a maximum operating frequency of 50 MHz, various communication interfaces, and four channels of configurable logic, the EFM8BB3 family is optimal for many embedded applications.

## Key Features

- Pipelined 8-bit 8051 MCU Core with 50 MHz operating frequency
- Up to 29 multifunction I/O pins
- One 12-bit/10-bit ADC
- Four 12-bit DACs with synchronization and PWM capabilities
- Two low-current analog comparators with built-in reference DACs
- Internal temperature sensor
- Internal 49 MHz and 24.5 MHz oscillators accurate to Â±2%
- Four channels of Configurable Logic
- 6-channel PWM / PCA
- Six 16-bit general-purpose timers

## Applications

- Consumer electronics
- Precision instrumentation
- Power management and control
