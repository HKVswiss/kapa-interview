# EFM8 Busy Bee Family - EFM8BB3 Data Sheet

The EFM8BB3, part of the Busy Bee family of MCUs, is a performance line of 8-bit microcontrollers with a comprehensive analog and digital feature set in small packages.

These devices offer state-of-the-art performance by integrating a 12-bit ADC, internal temperature sensor, and up to four 12-bit DACs into small packages, making them ideal for general purpose applications. With an efficient, pipelined 8051 core with a maximum operating frequency of 50 MHz, various communication interfaces, and four channels of configurable logic, the EFM8BB3 family is optimal for many embedded applications.
