The ESP8266EX schematics include seven aspects:

- Power supply
- Power-on sequence and reset
- Flash
- Crystal oscillator
- RF
- External resistor
- UART

## 1.4.1. Power Supply

### 1.4.1.1. Digital Power Supply

ESP8266EX has two digital pins for power supply, Pin 11 and Pin 17. For digital power supply, there is no need to add additional filter capacitors. The operating voltage range of digital power supply pins is 1.8 V to 3.3 V.
