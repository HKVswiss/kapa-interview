## Crystal Oscillator

The ESP8266EX supports crystal oscillators of 40 MHz, 26 MHz, and 24 MHz. It is important to select the correct type of crystal oscillator in the ESP Flash Download Tool.

In the circuit design, capacitors C1 and C2 are connected to ground and are added to the input and output terminals of the crystal oscillator respectively. The capacitor values can range from 6 pF to 22 pF, but the exact values should be determined by testing and adjusting the overall circuit performance. The crystal precision should be within Â±10 PPM.

| Pin Name   | Description       |
|------------|-------------------|
| VDDD       | Power supply      |
| XTAL_IN    | Crystal oscillator input |
| XTAL_OUT   | Crystal oscillator output|
| UOTXD      | UART TX           |
| UORXD      | UART RX           |
| XIN        | Crystal input     |
| GND        | Ground            |
| XOUT       | Crystal output    |

**Notice:**

Defects in the craftsmanship of the crystal oscillators, such as high frequency deviation and unstable working temperature, may cause malfunction of the ESP8266EX and degrade overall performance.
