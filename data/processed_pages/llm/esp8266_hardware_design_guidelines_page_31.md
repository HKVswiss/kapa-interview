# ESP-LAUNCHER

## 2.3.2. 5V Power Supply

The 5V power supply section of the ESP-LAUNCHER is designed to provide stable 5V output for the module. The schematic includes components such as inductors, resistors, capacitors, and a power LED indicator.

**Key components and signals:**
- AN_SY8088 (likely a power management IC)
- Inductor: 22uH
- Resistors: 2k, 680k, 150k, 22F (likely a capacitor value)
- Toggle Switch
- 5V Power LED
- Ground (GND) connections

The power supply schematic is shown in Figure 2-3.

## 2.3.3. Test Module

The test module schematic for the ESP-LAUNCHER includes various GPIO pins and interfaces for testing the ESP-WROOM-01/02 module.

**Key signals and pins include:**
- GPIO pins: GPIO0, GPIO2, GPIO5, GPIO12, GPIO13, GPIO14, GPIO15, GPIO16
- SPI signals: SPI0_RS, D_CMD, UOTXD, JOTXD, DL_CLK, JORXD, SODO, DDO
- Power signals: VOPS3, VOPA3, VOO33
- Ground (GND) connections
- ESP_Test board connections

The schematic is shown in Figure 2-4.
